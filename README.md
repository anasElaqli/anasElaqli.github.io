I also built my own portfolio mostly from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Creating this portfolio was a journey, as it was quite difficult to stick to a specific design because I wanted it to look as good as possible.

However, I learned a lot more about front-end development while creating my portfolio.
I'm pretty happy with the current version, but I'm always open to more improvements. And I'm excited to add bigger projects to it.
